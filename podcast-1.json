Bill O'Reilly here and I'm warming up. Stand by for the O'Reilly Update Morning Edition. But first. On this Monday, fear the walking Trump. He could win re-election as the country descends into chaos. You can't deny it. The border, crime, the economy, and overseas threats all are reaching critical mass. And President Biden, the Democratic Party, and the leftist media have no solutions whatsoever. None. So as things get worse in 2023, which they will, an Avenger like Donald Trump takes on more momentum. His message is very simple. The country's going to hell and I, Donald Trump, can stop that. I can correct the wrongs. Because during my four years in office, with the exception of COVID, which nobody could stop, Trump governed pretty effectively. The economy was good. Wages were up. People were working. Overseas was fairly calm. There was no border craziness because of the remain in Mexico policy. And crime in the streets while on the rise was nothing like it is now. So you may not like him and millions of Americans do not, but Donald Trump is a viable presidential candidate in 2024. Back in a moment.
